Making full pipeline for short stamen loss project

This code is a bit of a mess at the moment. The number in front of each file indicates what order in the pipeline it is. When there are doubles, the '_all my code' version will have a whole bunch of things that didn't work and the other verision will be edited down to be a more sharable version.

I also apparently have old code, so pay attention to the date espcially for pixy. some things are also .Rmd files that have been knitted, so they have accompanying .html files but I"m not sure when the last time I actually knitted it is :)

In general this project needs new organization so that it is synced with the HPCC and the code is in a similar place to all the data, but currently the code is here and the data is there and I do lots of copying and pasting... room for workflow improvement!

Most of the data is in my scratch space, but the most important things should be backed up to the josephslab directory, but some things are backed up twice and it isn't super organized.
