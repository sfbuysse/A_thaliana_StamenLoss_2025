## here only use the sequenced lines because that is what pi was calculated from

##### Correlation/regressions between Variables #######
### Pi and Elevation ###
plot(Mean.pi ~ Elev_m, data = comp)
### SSN and Elevation ###
## Do this with the Full means because we want the best picture of each popualtion
